  # My Portfolio

  ## Description

This is my portfolio website showcasing who I am, some of my work, and how to contact me. The application is built using react, with props for projects, and a navigation component to render different sections. It uses the emailJS dependency to send emails to my email address when a message is submitted in the Contact section.
