          I am the Engineering Manager for Smart Bar USA. Smart bar USA is a
          company that provides automated cocktail dispensers to the Hospitality
          industry. I oversee all engineering activities and development
          personnel for the business. Currently this includes a dedicated
          contract software development team of 3 developers, and one contract
          electronics engineer and mechanical engineer who work on an as needed
          basis for Smart Bar USA. In addition to managing the engineering team,
          I also do most of the mechanical design, R&D, testing, and validation
          of all of Smart Bar USA's products.<br></br>

          As the son of the local small engine repair shop owner located in a
          small farming community in Ohio, it was an easy decision to get a
          Bachelors Degree in Mechanical Engineering after high school. After
          college I worked with GE Appliances in Louisvillle, KY. While
          completing the GE rotational engineering development program I got a
          Masters Degree in Mechanical Engineering, specializing in appliance
          design. I then decided to take a Senior Mechanical Engineering role
          with Smart Bar USA and moved into the Engineering Manager posiition
          for the company as the team grew. After a few years of managing the
          team, I decided to try to learn what my software team was talking
          about and signed up a Software Development Bootcamp. Since being in
          the UC Berkeley Bootcamp, I have found software development to be very
          interesting and fun!
